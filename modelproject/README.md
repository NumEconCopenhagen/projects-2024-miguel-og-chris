# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Malthusian Growth Model** and seeks to illustrate the dynamics of malthusian growth theory.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

The file modelproject.py contains all algorithms and function sused in the project. 
We have built two classes: 1. MalthusEconomyBaseline and 2. MalthusEconomyStochasticTechnology.
We use these classes in the jupyter notebook, but the quality of code should be assessed via the py-file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
