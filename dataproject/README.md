Our project is titled 'Relationship between public debt and GDP growth' and seeks to analyse the relationship GDP growth and Public debt for Sub-Saharan countries specifically looking at differences in this relationship for different kind of countries. 

We apply the following datasets:

1. DebtData-All.csv  (source: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/GGXWDG_GDP@AFRREO/SSA/OEXP/OIMP/STP/ZMB/ERI)
2. GDPGrowthData-All.csv (source:https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPRPC_PCH@AFRREO/SSA/OEXP/OIMP/ERI)

Which is retrieved from IMF's database 'AFR REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK'. The definitions of the different groups of countries can be found in the statistical appendix for the database.
