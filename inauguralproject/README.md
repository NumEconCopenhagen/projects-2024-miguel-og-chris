# Inaugural project

We have solved the problems of the Inaugural Project 2024.
The file inauguralproject.ipynb contains a majority of the code, all answers and graphs.
the file inauguralproject.py contains the ExchangeEconomyClass, which is imported and used within the ipynb file. We have added a small number of functions to the class. Specifically we have added moderated copies of the functions demand_A, demand_B and check_market_clearing, such that the functions can take endowments as inputs as well. These functions we call emand_A_endowment, demand_B_endowment and check_market_clearing_endowment.
